# Hotel-Transaction-Dashboard
This project was part of a capstone requirement for my data analysis class with Datafied Academy
Timeline: The entire project was completed within a month (less maybe)

The data used for the analysis was sourced from an open source on hotel transactions. 

DETAILED PROJECT CHALLENGE

Problem Statement:
Company A is facing challenges in tracking business operations and maintaining an efficient process due to issues with its current data infrastructure. They have approached Datafied to develop an end-to-end data analytics solution to address their data management needs and provide valuable insights. Your task is to design this data analytics solution by leveraging available analytics frameworks.

Project Requirements:
The project requirements are as follows, and you are encouraged to propose additional steps for the best solution:

1. Perform data inspection in Excel and create a report on the findings.
2. Create a database named "Revenue" with the following tables:
Sales: containing sales transactions from 2018, 2019, and 2020.
Meal_cost: for meal cost information.
Market_segment: for market segment details.
Add discount and meal price columns to the Sales table.
3. Generate a report using SQL queries to answer important business questions and create a slide presentation from it. The business questions to address are:
Provide summary statistics of sales data for the three years.
What are the average daily rates (ADR) for different types of meals?
How many bookings were canceled by the market segment?
What ten countries had the least number of bookings?
What are the most popular meal packages booked by customers?
Which country has the highest number of bookings in the database?
What is the average number of special requests made by customers for different room types?
What is the average lead time for bookings made through travel agents compared to tour operators?
What is the average number of days bookings spend on the waiting list before confirmation, and how does it vary across different market segments?
How does the average daily rate (ADR) differ for repeated guests compared to new customers?
4. Connect the database to Power BI and design a dashboard to provide real-time insights to the company.

Deliverables:
Company A expects a comprehensive end-to-end data analytics solution that can be easily transferred to its data team. Detailed documentation is crucial for the project completion.
